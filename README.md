# Overview of passwordcreator
    This class makes a password of a given length, the length has to be at least 4 
    characters in length. This is because the password must have at least one special character, one number, 
    one uppercase letter and one lower case letter. If the password is more than 4 characters in length the rest
    of the characters will be a random special character, number, uppercase letter or lower case letter.

# Running passwordcreator
    When running the passwordcreator class it will ask for a password length, the length must be greater than 4.
    Password creator will then create a password of that length.

# Possible misuse
    This password creator could be modified to ask for a website name and username for the website before 
    generating a password. Which would allow for the creator to act with malicious intent and misuse that information. 
    This code could be modified to store individuals passwords with a good goal in mind to help users in case they 
    forget their passwords. This could be switched to malpractice if all the saved passwords were sold to a separate 
    company. 

# Responsibilities of users
    Users must store the passwords themselves as the code does not save generated passwords.
